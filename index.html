            Gran Canaria is renewing the certificate that declares the Island’s Biosphere Reserve a Starlight
            Destination!<br>
            Gran Canaria continues to gaze dreamily up at the skies, with a passion that expands throughout the
            universe. The Island has renewed the certificate declaring its Biosphere Reserve a Starlight Destination
            until 2025. This certification recognises its commitment to astrotourism and consequently to protecting its
            night skies, keeping that extraordinary window on the stars wide open, for people from all over the world to
            gaze out of every day.<br>
            UNESCO’s decision, through the Starlight Foundation, also supported by the International Astronomy Union and
            the World Tourism Organisation, backs Gran Canaria’s work since 2018 to make the island an international
            benchmark for star-gazing.<br>
            Gran Canaria seems to be a watchtower over other worlds thanks to its geographic relief, its many
            observation sites 600 to 1,800 metres above sea level, the quality of its skies and a strategic position
            which provides an amazing view of swathes of southern skies and constellations plus celestial objects that
            are invisible from mainland Europe.

        </div>
        <p class="lanzarote">
            Lanzarote is synonymous with volcanoes, lava fields, rocks in impossible shapes, black and red earth that
            contrasts with the typical whitewashed houses, the deep blue sea and the light blue sky. The scenery in the
            easternmost of the Canary Islands also contains stark, rolling mountains, beautiful beaches of white and
            golden sand, lush palm groves… and silence, which is also an enigmatic part of the Lanzarote landscape.<br>
            On this biosphere reserve island, there are lively tourist resorts and little villages where all is peace
            and quiet. The large hotels and bungalows of the coastal towns coexist with rural houses, villas and
            boutique hotels in the charming inland villages. A full top-class range to guarantee the best holidays at
            any time of year in the extraordinary climate. Unbeatable conditions, along with quality services and
            infrastructures, that professionals and amateurs of all kinds of sports have found on this island for
            training.

        <p class="fuerteventura">
            Almost 150 kilometres of picture-perfect beaches and only one problem: picking which one to visit! An issue
            that can easily be solved by going to a new one every day. Today, we’ll explore some large beaches
            surrounded by endless dunes; tomorrow, the little ones can have a safe swim in the crystal-clear lagoons
            that form between sandbanks and natural reefs; the next day, we might feel a bit more adventurous and we can
            go as far as the wild solitary beaches, which have been the sets of major film productions, or take a boat
            trip to a little islet off the coast for some unforgettable moments.<br>
            Windsurfing and kitesurfing are the kings of water sports on this island. Amateurs and top-class
            professionals alike can find perfect conditions for riding the waves and taking on the wind any day in
            Fuerteventura.<br>
            For those who have always dreamt of the excitement of getting on a board and heading out to sea, this is the
            perfect opportunity. The island has specialist companies and schools that provide everything necessary for
            practising or getting started in these sports, offering a highly professional, quality service with decades
            of experience. Proof of that is that the Windsurfing and Kiteboarding World Championship has been held on
            the wonderful beaches of Jandía for years now, with the participation of elite international sportspeople.
